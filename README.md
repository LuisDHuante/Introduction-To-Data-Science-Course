### Analysis of Titanic data
For this project, Titanic data was used to answer questions through simple data analysis. Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib were used.

### Metrics and Cross Validation
Several machine learning algorithms were used to classify the GDP type of a country given its data. A prior data wrangling was performed and the data were processed using pandas. The efficiency of the models was evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, accuracy and $F_beta$ with cross validation. The process was done with Python's sklearn library.

## Beautiful Soup
