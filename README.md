Projects, activities and exercises conducted for the Introduction to Data Science class. All the material is in Spanish

## Affiliation
Final project for the Supervised Learning 2022-2 class, at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), in its ENES Morelia Campus, as part of its Bs. in Data Science career plan. 

## Analysis of Titanic data
For this project, Titanic data was used to answer questions through simple data analysis. Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib were used. All the work is compiled in [this .ipynb notebook.](https://github.com/LuisDHuante/Introduction-To-Data-Science-Course/blob/main/Proyecto1_Titanic.ipynb)


## Metrics and Cross Validation
Several machine learning algorithms were used to classify the GDP type of a country given its data. A prior data wrangling was performed and the data were processed using pandas. The efficiency of the models was evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, accuracy and $F_beta$ with cross validation. The process was done with Python's sklearn library.  All the work is compiled in [this .ipynb notebook.](https://github.com/LuisDHuante/Introduction-To-Data-Science-Course/blob/main/Proyecto2_ValidacionCruzadaMetricas_LDHG.ipynb)


## Beautiful Soup
This project consisted of using the Python BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from the [Books To Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/) website. All the work is compiled in [this .ipynb notebook.](https://github.com/LuisDHuante/Introduction-To-Data-Science-Course/blob/main/Proyecto3_WebScraping_LDHG2.ipynb)

## Introduction to Scrapy
This project consisted of using the Python library, Scrapy, to extract country data from [The World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/). All the work is compiled in [this .ipynb notebook.](https://github.com/LuisDHuante/Introduction-To-Data-Science-Course/blob/main/Proyecto4_Scrapy_LDHG.ipynb)
